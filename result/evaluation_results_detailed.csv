Given the nature of the image, which seems to be a smooth, gradient-like transition of colors without any discernible patterns or objects that suggest texture, the description of its tactile properties would be purely interpretative and based on the visual cues present.

However, since the task is to list key tactile attributes as a comma-separated list based on the image, and considering the image does not directly suggest specific textures (like rough, smooth, bumpy, etc.), a reasonable interpretation could lean towards the implied smoothness and uniformity of the color transition, which might suggest a tactile experience akin to touching a smooth surface.

Therefore, a possible list of tactile attributes, keeping in mind the abstract and somewhat uniform nature of the image, could be: smooth, uniform, flat, soft, even.
